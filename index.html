        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Hello! We are Dea (12) and Dev Singh Chitalkar (7), 2 siblings who live in Delhi have cultivated and delivered this package to you with love & care. Before you begin uncovering what we have sent you, we would like to tell you about how exactly we did this.</p>
        
        <p>Our backstory is, we live on a farm in the bustling city of Delhi, and our parents bought this remote property a little over a year ago In Kerala, near the Wayanad reigon. We visit this secluded farm 1-2 times a year, we were recently there.</p>

         <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">A birds eye view of our farm!</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>In case you didn't know, these spices were picked straight off peppercorn and nutmeg (jadi) trees on our family's property nestled in the lush expanse of the Wayanad mountains. Fun fact, we don't just have peppercorn and nutmeg, we also discovered banana trees and other medicinal plants like an insulin plant we sent to test on our most recent trip there. On this trip we celeberated Holi with the family.</p>

            <p class="image-caption">This is us celerating Holi!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>To start off, let us explain how we harvested these spices.</h2>
        
        <h3>Peppercorn\Pepper</h3>
        <p>Pepper grows on climbing vines. When the tiny green berries ripen, they turn red. We carefully handpick them, then dry them in the sun until they transform into the black peppercorns that you find in curry and other indian dishes. You can also put it on omlettes (important for protein) & pasta (which we love). <br> Another fun fact is that pepper is one of the most globally popular condiments, however, salt may be more popular.</p>
        
        <h3>Nutmeg</h3>
        <p>Nutmeg grows on a short tree, it starts out yellow and when ripe, splits open to reveal the nutmeg seed, surrounded by a delicate, red covering known as mace. After carefully harvesting the seeds, we dry them until they become the familiar nutmeg spice that is used in everything from curries to desserts.</p>
        
        <h2>Let me tell you why we grow our own spices at home.</h2>
        <p>Growing spices at home enhances food security, health, and sustainability. Cultivating spices like pepper and nutmeg ensures a reliable, organic source of high-quality ingredients, reducing dependence on external and inflated markets. These spices provide nutritional and medicinal benefits, supporting better health, while local growth reduces carbon footprint, promoting environmental sustainability. Overall, it nurtures a more resilient and eco-conscious food system.</p>
        
        <h2>What's in the box & how do we recommend you use it?</h2>
        
        <div class="gift-item">
            <h3>1. Peppercorn</h3>
            <p>These are hand picked from peppercorn trees dotted all over our property</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Once picked, the peppercorns will come to you in colours like green, red, or black.</li>
                <li>Peppercorns are supposed to be dried for 4-5 days after harvesting, so please make sure to dry them in the sun for a few days before grinding them using the grinder we sent you.</li>
                <li> To preserve the natural aromatic scent of the peppercorns, after drying these, place them in an airtight container for a few hours before grinding. This is because too much exposure to sunlight can in fact drain this scent.</li>
                <li>Fun facts- Pepper is the most prominent plant on our farm as of now!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="gift-item">
            <h3>2. Nutmeg</h3>
            <p>Along with peppercorns, our package consists of a nutmeg fruit along with a few nutmeg seeds. These are also hand picked from trees that stand tall in the valley engulfing our home. You can grate the dried nutmeg onto your food.</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>If you wish to bring out the fully developed flavour, please try to put the nutmeg fruit out in the sun to dry for 6-7 weeks.

        <p>Peppercorn is harvested from pepper trees, and in this case, the trees we collected peppercorns from that grow in a remote property tucked in the expanse of the Wayanad mountains that spread across northeast Kerala. However, peppercorn trees thrive all over Kerala, in places like Thrissur, Kottayam, and of course, Wayanad.</p>
        
        <h3>Harvesting and grinding Peppercorns?</h3>
        <h4>1- Ripening stage</h4>
        <p>Peppercorns grow in green clusters and ripen over time. They start off as green, then turn yellow, and eventually become red when fully ripe. The timing of harvesting depends on the type of pepper (black, white, or green) you want to produce.</p>
        <p>For black pepper, (Which is what we harvested) black pepper is harvested when the peppercorns are still green but have started to turn slightly yellow. At this stage, the berries are just beginning to ripen but are not fully mature.</p>
        
        <h4>2- Harvesting-</h4>
        <p>The process involves carefully picking the peppercorn clusters by hand, usually from tall vines. Farmers use ladders or long poles to reach higher parts of the plant. It's important to avoid damaging the vines and unripe peppercorns during this process.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="HarvestingPepper-min.png" alt="Harvesting Peppercorn">
            <p class="image-caption">This is one of the trees we got peppercorn for you from, we used a ladder to take out some of the fruits</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Processing</h4>
        <p>For black pepper, the harvested green berries are dried in the sun or using mechanical dryers. This drying process shrinks the berries, darkens the skin, and gives the peppercorns their characteristic wrinkled appearance.</p>
        
        <h4>Grinding-</h4>
        <p>Since the peppercorns have just been sun-dried, store them in an airtight container to preserve the natural, aromatic scent that peppercorns carry. This scent will fade if the peppercorns are exposed to sunlight for too long.</p>
        <p>The process of grinding peppercorns is simple. Peppercorns can be grinded using an electric grinder or food processor. Just put your peppercorns in the grinder until they have become pepper. However, there are many different ways peppercorn is grinded. They include-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using a pepper mill, which involves simply placing the dried peppercorns in the mill's chamber, and turning the mechanism to grind them. Most mills allow you to adjust the grind size, from coarse to fine.</li>
            <li>Using a mortar and pestle involves placing the dried peppercorns in the mortar and crushing them with the pestle by pressing and twisting. This method allows you to control the coarseness of the grind and release the full flavor of the peppercorns.</li>
            <li>Lastly, as earlier mentioned, one can use an electric grinder or food processor to grind peppercorn.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Nutmeg (Jadi)</h3>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Nutmeg-min.png" alt="Nutmeg Tree">
            <p class="image-caption">This is what a nutmeg tree looks like!</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Nutmegs are found growing on lush nutmeg trees. We found these in the same area in which we harvested peppercorn. Nutmeg trees thrive in the humid, tropical regions of Kerala, especially in areas like Idukki, Wayanad, and Kottayam, which are known for their spice plantations.</p>
        
        <h3>What is the process of harvesting nutmeg?</h3>
        
        <h4>Ripening stage-</h4>
        <p>Nutmeg fruits ripen once they turn a yellow or orange color. This is the time when they are ready for harvest. The fruit is usually harvested when it falls naturally from the tree or can be picked manually by climbing the tree. The ideal time to harvest is when the fruit begins to split open slightly, indicating that it is ripe and the nutmeg seed inside is mature.</p>
        
        <h4>Harvesting-</h4>
        <p>The ripe fruits are carefully harvested by hand. They may fall from the tree naturally when fully ripe, or they can be collected by shaking the tree or using poles to reach the higher branches. After picking, the fruits should be handled gently to avoid damaging the delicate seeds inside.</p>
        
        <h4>Extracting nutmeg and mace-</h4>
        <p>Once harvested, the fruit is cut open to reveal the seed (which will become the nutmeg) and the outer covering (mace). Mace is the reddish, fleshy covering around the seed that is carefully peeled off by hand. This is dried separately. Nutmeg is the seed inside, which is removed from the fruit and cleaned to remove any remaining pulp.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Jadi-min.png" alt="Nutmeg Tree">
            <p class="image-caption">The fruit in your box, up on the tree!</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Drying-</h4>
        <p>For mace, it is spread out in the sun and dried for about 10 to 12 days. As it dries, it turns orange-red and becomes brittle. Once dried, mace is used in cooking or ground into mace powder. The seeds (nutmeg) are dried by sun-drying for about 7-10 days, depending on weather conditions. As they dry, the seeds shrink, and the nutmeg becomes hard and dark brown in color. In some cases, the nutmeg is dried in a well-ventilated area or under controlled conditions using mechanical dryers to speed up the drying process.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container">

            <p class="image-caption">This is how green, red, and black pepper dries. (And nutmeg). We laid it out for a couple of days near our pool where we get the most sun</p>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Storage-</h4>
        <p>Nutmeg seeds are stored in a cool, dry place to maintain their flavor and freshness. Whole nutmeg is preferred over pre-ground nutmeg because it retains its essential oils and flavor for a longer period.</p>
        
        <h4>Final product-</h4>
        <p>The whole dried nutmeg can be sold whole and grated as needed for cooking. Nutmeg can also be ground into powder, which is commonly used as a spice in cooking and baking.</p>
